Msg

Concept

	A fast, small, simple IRC program.


Design

	Single connection

	Multiple channels

	Stream-based


Features

	Small

	Fast

	Unix-compatible


Additional IRC Commands

	/msg	Sends a private message to a user


Ideas

	It could be turned into a "Swiss army knife" of connections and protocols by adding a "piping" syntax.

	Examples

		msg from irc://bot@irc.freenode.net:6667#minix to stdout

		msg from http://www.google.com/ to irc://bot@irc.freenode.net:6667#something

		msg from irc://pikpik@irc.freenode.net:6667#minix to me

		msg from irc://pikpik@irc.freenode.net:6667 to me and file://log.txt

		msg from http://wikipedia.org/ and http://google.com to file://mess.txt


	Or

		msg irc://pikpik@irc.freenode.net:6667

			When pipes are detected:

			Standard input is interpreted as messages or commands as if typed, per line.

			Standard output is what is seen by the user, minus the message editing line.


			When no pipes are detected:

			The behavior is the same, except that the message editing line is used instead of standard input.
