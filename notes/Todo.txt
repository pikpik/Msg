I need to make the cursor jump to the correct position when something's pasted.

I need to add IRC protocol support.

I should add a text-entry prompt indicator.

I should either restrict typing to a single line or handle multi-line editing.

I need to track down places where partial messages are sent.

I should try using a memory leak tool to find why its crashing on some lengths of text sent or received.
